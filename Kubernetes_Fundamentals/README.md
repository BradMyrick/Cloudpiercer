# Kubernetes Fundamentals

Welcome to the Kubernetes Fundamentals module of the Cloudpiercer course. This module is designed to introduce you to the core concepts and tools of Kubernetes, with a focus on using Go (Golang) for projects and examples. As Go is the language Kubernetes itself is written in, it provides a powerful toolset for interacting with Kubernetes APIs and building cloud-native applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basic architecture and components of Kubernetes.
- Learn to deploy and manage containerized applications using Kubernetes.
- Gain proficiency in using `kubectl` and writing YAML configuration files.
- Develop Kubernetes applications and tools using Go.
- Explore hands-on labs to reinforce learning through practical application.

## Resources and Tutorials

- **Kubernetes Basics with Go**: [Kubernetes Official Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/)
- **Go Client for Kubernetes**: [Kubernetes Client Go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) - Learn how to interact with Kubernetes clusters using Go.
